lighting:
objects can inherit lighting that specifies how bright something is and whether it flickers.

upgrade:
only one concept of upgrade. units specialise once when doing one thing for a long time.
so practising fighting gives you a shield so you block all weak attacks, and deflect some major blows.
farming gives you a pitchfork and a hat and improves farming speed.

context actions:
i want it so - turn based - but if you're chopping wood itll just do this - until something arises that needs your attention.
So a bear appears - its a - does he run, dodge, shout, draw sword etc.
when everyone is just chopping wood (ie no idle people, or people requesting help), moves just have a timer running down with pause/ continue option.

gameplay:
its important for creative descisions - the best approach with the tech available is map altering actions.
this needs fleshing out, but obvious things like walls etc
but absolutely needs turn-based big map changes to keep things feeling dynamic.
 - so mass flooding - maybe you cause this.
 - set forests on fire to flush out enemies (but this might deplete your wood stock etc)


levels:
people will play for about 5 mins.
have non-synchronous levels (all unlocked) so scenarios of different difficulties that last about this length.
